        <h1>Pasta</h1>

        <img src="../images/pasta.webp" alt="Very nice pasta">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Yeah, that's it. Very easy and fast.</p>
        <p>Not Great, Not Terrible.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul id="ingredients">
            <li>1 pound uncooked pasta</li>
            <li>A large (6- to 8-quart) pot</li>
            <li>Four to six quarts of cold water</li>
            <li>1-2 tablespoons of salt</li>
            <li>A long-handled heat-proof spoon</li>
            <li>A colander for draining the pasta</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol id="steps">
            <li>
                <b>Bring the water to a full, rolling boil.</b> Before adding the pasta, <b>add salt to the boiling water</b>. If you don't season the cooking water, the pasta may taste flat — no matter how salty the sauce may be. The temperature of the water will drop once you add the pasta, so make sure the water's at a full boil before adding the pasta noodles. 
                <p>*Note: Be careful when you add the pasta to your boiling water; sometimes, the water can splash up and you don't want to burn your hands.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Stir gently.</b> Short pasta should be stirred immediately after adding it to water, but let spaghetti and long strands soften for a minute before stirring. Leave the pot uncovered while the pasta cooks.</li>
            <li>
                <b>Cook your pasta at a rapid boil until it's tender but slightly firm to the bite.</b> The longer you cook pasta, the mushier it gets. Don't rely on the clock to evaluate doneness; bite a piece instead. If it's done, it will be firm but tender and cooked through. If you're using cooked pasta as an ingredient in a recipe — like baked ziti or lasagna — it can be even firmer, as the noodles will absorb liquid and cook more in the oven.
                <p>*Note: If you're tossing the pasta with a sauce, reserve a cup or two of the cooking water before you drain the pot. The starch in the cooking water can thin a thick sauce and help sauces stick to the noodles.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Drain the pasta in a colander./b> Do not rinse the pasta with water unless your recipe specifically says to. For example, if you're making a cold pasta salad, you would rinse the hot pasta with cool water to stop the cooking. Lasagna is another example of a pasta noodle that can be rinsed after cooking. Otherwise, return the drained pasta to the pot and cover to keep it warm, or toss it with sauce. Here's where the reserved pasta water comes in handy to help thicken or thin the sauce, depending on the recipe you use.</li>
            <li><b>Serve pasta immediately.</b> We highly recommend using warm bowls!</li>
        </ol>
