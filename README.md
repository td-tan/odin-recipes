# odin-recipes

A milestone in the Foundation Course of The Odin Project.

This will be a basic recipe website.

## After

My HTML knowledge was already solid, so it was not challenge for me.

However, instead my commit messages were all over the place before this project.

I took this opportunity to focus on my commits. I tried the [Conventional Commits Standard](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). I personally like it.
